# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter tweets

In this notebook, I  used data extracted from Twitter regarding the currency demonetization in India in 2016 to apply sentiment analysis. I  classified the tweets to positive, negative & neutral. It is kind of unsupervised learning since we do not have a target variable. Further, I have done data cleaning since the tweets are not clean and have a lot of noise.

After creating a target variable by the sentiment analysis, I  trained classfication model using the labeled data.

The source of data is kaggle, and I have already uploaded the dataset to this repository.
